# CMS Implementation Overview

This document provides a high-level overview of the comprehensive CMS architecture, designed to replace the current JSON-based approach with a fully relational database structure.

## Implementation Approach

There are two potential approaches to implementing this architecture:

1. **Start a new project**: Create a fresh Laravel project and implement the architecture from scratch.
2. **Rebuild within current project**: Gradually replace components of the existing project.

Given that the project is still in development, starting fresh is recommended for a cleaner implementation.

## Core Principles

1. **Fully Relational Data**: No JSON columns, all data stored in properly structured tables
2. **Separation of Concerns**: Clear separation between content definition and content instances
3. **Theme Flexibility**: Support for multiple themes with consistent content structure
4. **Extensibility**: Easy to add new widget types and templates
5. **Performance**: Optimized database structure for efficient queries

## Implementation Phases

1. **Database Structure**: Create all necessary tables and relationships
2. **Core Models**: Implement Eloquent models with relationships
3. **Admin System**: Build the administrative interface
4. **Theme System**: Implement theme management and rendering
5. **Frontend Rendering**: Develop the public-facing website

## Directory Structure

The implementation plan is organized into the following documents:

1. `01-database-structure.md`: Database tables and relationships
2. `02-models-and-relationships.md`: Eloquent models and their relationships
3. `03-controllers-and-routes.md`: Controller structure and routing
4. `04-theme-system.md`: Theme architecture and implementation
5. `05-widget-system.md`: Widget architecture and implementation
6. `06-admin-interface.md`: Administrative interface design
7. `07-frontend-rendering.md`: Public website rendering
8. `08-migration-strategy.md`: Strategy for migrating from the current system

## Technology Stack

- **Framework**: Laravel (latest version)
- **Database**: MySQL/MariaDB
- **Frontend**: Blade templates with optional Vue.js components
- **CSS**: SCSS with a component-based approach
- **JavaScript**: ES6+ with optional TypeScript
- **Build System**: Laravel Mix/Vite

## Next Steps

Review each implementation document to understand the detailed architecture and implementation steps. Once you're comfortable with the plan, decide whether to start a new project or rebuild within the current one.
