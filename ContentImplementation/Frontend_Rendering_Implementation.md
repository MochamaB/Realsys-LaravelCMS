# Frontend Rendering System Implementation

## Overview

This document outlines the implementation plan for the basic frontend rendering system of our CMS. This system will allow us to render pages using templates and sections, providing a way to test and validate the admin functionality we've already built.

## Current Implementation Status

As of now, we have implemented:
1. **Theme System**: Theme management, activation, and asset publication
2. **Template System**: Template creation, management, and section definition
3. **Page System (Admin)**: Page CRUD operations with template selection UI and section management

To complement these systems, we need a frontend rendering pipeline that can:
1. Resolve URLs to pages
2. Load the appropriate template for a page
3. Render the template with the page's content and sections
4. Display the resulting HTML to the user

## Implementation Steps

### 1. Frontend Controller and Routing

The first step is to create a controller and routes that can handle frontend page requests:

#### Components:
- **Frontend Controller**: Responsible for resolving URLs to pages and rendering them
- **Fallback Route**: A catch-all route that will attempt to match URLs to page slugs
- **Home Page Route**: A specific route for the homepage

#### Implementation Tasks:
1. Create `FrontendController` with methods for rendering pages
2. Set up a route to handle homepage requests
3. Set up a fallback route for all other page URLs
4. Add middleware for theme activation and asset loading

### 2. Page Resolution System

This system will handle the logic of finding the correct page based on the URL:

#### Components:
- **Page Resolver Service**: Responsible for finding pages based on slugs
- **Hierarchy Resolution**: Support for nested URLs and parent/child page relationships

#### Implementation Tasks:
1. Create `PageResolver` service to find pages by slug
2. Add support for resolving nested pages (e.g., `/parent/child`)
3. Implement caching for frequently accessed pages
4. Add handling for 404 errors when pages are not found

### 3. Template Rendering Pipeline

This system will handle loading and rendering templates with page content:

#### Components:
- **Page Renderer Service**: Orchestrates the rendering process
- **Section Renderer**: Renders individual sections with their content

#### Implementation Tasks:
1. Create `PageRenderer` service to handle the rendering process
2. Enhance the existing `TemplateRenderer` service to work with frontend pages
3. Implement blade directives for template and section rendering
4. Add support for template inheritance and layout composition

### 4. Section Display System

This system will handle rendering sections with their content:

#### Components:
- **Section Display Templates**: Blade templates for different section types
- **Section Content Loader**: Service to load content for sections

#### Implementation Tasks:
1. Create default section display templates for different section types (header, footer, content, etc.)
2. Implement `SectionContentLoader` to prepare content for sections
3. Add blade components for section rendering
4. Create a basic widget display system for sections that contain widgets

### 5. Theme Integration

This system will ensure that the frontend rendering works with the active theme:

#### Components:
- **Theme Assets Loader**: Service to load theme CSS, JavaScript, and other assets
- **Theme-specific Templates**: Support for theme overrides of system templates

#### Implementation Tasks:
1. Implement `ThemeAssetsLoader` to load theme-specific CSS and JavaScript
2. Add support for theme-specific template overrides
3. Create a fallback mechanism for missing theme templates
4. Implement theme hooks for customization

```

## Implementation Priority

1. **First Priority**: Basic page rendering with templates
2. **Second Priority**: Section rendering
3. **Third Priority**: Theme integration
4. **Fourth Priority**: URL resolution and hierarchy

## Testing Plan

1. Create test pages with different templates
2. Test rendering of pages with their templates
3. Verify that template sections are correctly displayed
4. Test URL resolution for different page hierarchies
5. Test theme switching and asset loading

## Expected Results

Upon completing this implementation, we should be able to:
1. Create pages in the admin area
2. Assign templates to pages
3. Visit the frontend URL for a page
4. See the page rendered with its assigned template
5. Verify that sections are correctly displayed

This basic frontend rendering system will allow us to validate our admin functionality and provide a foundation for more advanced features like widgets and content connections in the future.
